# Home Alone X - Approaching another weekend
Hello everyone. For days now I've been waiting for an E-mail. Nothing arrived, so I decided to make it a trend, and cut off all human relations. As the week-end approaches, I'm moving further and further into solitude, determined to silence Tamar away. Those of you who witnessed her in HA(tm) last tuesday may get a clear grasp why. The rest of the evening was even worse, and if it wasn't for beloved Spivak, who came to rescue me from Cafe Bazel, I would have probably died of despair. Just to think I've started this week with such a positive attitude (a lot due to you, Guy) and I'm ending it feeling like shit. Casually checking my grades over the phone revealed a despairing 44 in Mivne Mahshevim. I'm going for at least 2 weeks in the desert. The funny thing is that I'm actually looking forward to it. Running away from it all.
That's it. All of you enjoy your lifes. I'll just drudge on to a another weekend full of food binging, bad TV, and self pity.

May God have mercy on us all.
Yariv.
