## Two Fat Guys - Food**

 

This page contains unedited writings, some of which were
published in various publications. The aforementioned publications have no legal
liability to the articles published on this site as these articles are unedited
and have not undergone legal examination. Unless otherwise mentioned, all
articles in this page were published and therefor all intellectual property
rights regarding them belongs to the publicaion which published them. The views
brought here are mine and mine only, and in no way reflect the views of
aforementions publications. If anyone feels they are offended by any of these

These are most of the food columns I've written (together with an [undisclosed party](mailto:2fg@yedtik.co.il), that appeared in [Tel-Aviv Magazine](http://www.tam.co.il):

In each of them, I tried to bring the unedited version, and the one that got published in the magazine itself. The left column is the unedited version.

The name "Two Fat Guys" is, of course, an homage to the legendary cooking show "Two fat ladies". To learn more about Two fat ladies, click [here](http://twofatladies.c1tv.com/).
