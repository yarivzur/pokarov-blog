# The Unwilling Confidant
It was 14:35. VL was sitting alone on the stairs at the cafeteria, donning his lumberjack hat and outdated sunglasses, reading 'Introduction to government and binding theory', when from the other end of the cafeteria galit approached him, wearing a breast enhancing gray sweater. She sat in front of him and a conversation commenced. Let me, your humble narrator, try and reconstruct that conversation for yea eager listeners:
[G]: Hi, how are you?
[V]: OK.
[G]: OK and better, or OK and worse?
[V]: OK and worse.
[G]: Oh, because I'm only worse, without the OK. So I thought that you would encourage me and tell me that everything will be OK.
[V]: Im not very strong on the empathy side.
[G]: Oh.
[V]: What happened, you're house burned down?
[G]: No, everything is falling apart. Say - can you ask you a question? about a friend of yours?
[V]: (silence)
[G]: It's about Guy.
[V]: Yea, I guessed it was
[G]: How long is he with a girlfriend?
[V]: Hmmm.. (computing... System low on resources...)
[G]: I mean, How many years?
[V]: Years?!
[G]: Months?
[V]: Months?! How about weeks? But, before I tell you, I want to know why you're asking. As a former Intelligance man, I'm not about to divulge information about my best friend without getting some information back.
[G]: Oh, so he's your best friend? So I guess you will go and tell him.
[V]: It will be on E-mail the evening
[G]: Its just that I saw him today with another girl, And it sort of confused me
[V]: Why did it confuse you?
[G]: Well, a month and a half ago, I got the impression he hit on me (Hithil iti - VL), like, I thought he asked me out, and now I see him with a girl.
[V]: He's with his girlfriend only a few weeks.
[G]: Oh.
[V]: Is that why you're depressed?
[G]: No, its just that someone disappointed me today.
[V]: Guy?
[G]: No, Someone else. alltough if it wasn't for the other one, the thing with guy would have been the disappointment of the day.
[V]: Aha. Did someone dump you?
[G]: No, one of my best friends (yedidim - VL) fell in love with me, and I wasn't interested, so he's sort of dumping me as a friend. Its the second friend I have that this is happening with.
[V]: Well, the logical conclusion is that if both your friends fell in love with you, maybe they think you're willing.
[G]: No, No way. I'm not giving off any signals. It's not in my character (Yea, right - VL)
[V]: Well. I guess they didn't feel the same way.
And thus ends the first, more interesting part of our tale. The rest of the conversation does not concern our blond suicidal comrade, so if there be a popular demand it will be brought to the forum.
Sleep well, fellow bretheren.
