television and internet.**

To borrow a metaphor from popular television,
where “Party for five” was once described as “The best series you’re not
watching right now”, Adam silver is the most influential person in the world of
basketball you never heard of. Silver, 37, is the president of NBA
Entertainment. NBA Entertainment is a subsidiary of the NBA, which controls all
the television broadcasts from the NBA and WNBA. As president of the company,
Silver is in charge of broadcast rights, still pictures, NBA magazines, player
interviews and the internet site, which makes him one of the most powerful
people in the world American sports and communication.

 

Silver grew up in a small peaceful town called Rye
in the state of new-york, and while he played high-school basketball, he never
thought he’d be involved in professional sports. After graduating from law
school and spent some time as a congressional aide, he joined a law firm which
focused on media business. In ’92 silver was appointed as David Stern’s
personal assistant. He’s been there since, promoting the media empire of the
best league in the world. He cane to Israel together with the Miami Heat,
taking care to use to time to create initial contact with the local DBS
company.

 

The biggest news Silver brings with him is the
launching of a special NBA TV channel next week, together with the league’s
tip-off, on November 2nd. It’s going to be an innovative channel
which is going to combine internet and television.

 

## What
are our chances of seeing this channel here in Israel?

“We are closely monitoring the technological
developments in the area of television in Israel for the past years. Now, with satellite
broadcasting coming to Israel, we’re thinking of showing the new channel
through them.”

 

***Does that mean that you started negotiations with
the DBS company****?*

“I would say initial discussions. This one of the
reasons I came to Israel. Once viewing packages (Tiering) is available in
Israel, we will be able to give our viewers something like two games a day, and
our new channel. We have her Arik Henig, which is the commissioner’s special
assistant to help us with this, and we would love to see him broadcast again.”

 

## What
would American viewers get to see on this channel next week?

 “First
of all, there wont be broadcasts of live games. The new channel, NBA.COM-TV
will supply the information around the games. It’s not a coincidence it has the
name of our web-site. We’re talking about a digital television channel which
will show content very similar to what we have on the web. I think this is one
of the first cases of an internet site which becomes a television channel, and
not the opposite.”

 

## How
exactly is it going to work?

“The screen will look very similar to the site,
with scores running on the bottom of the screen, with constant data and
statistics fed to the viewers. We want that when a basketball fan comes home at
night, he’ll open our channel, instead of having to wait in other channels
until they get to cover the NBA. In our channel, he will get direct and updated
information on the games, referalls to live broadcasts, and the magazines we
produce.”

 

## The
means the channel will mainly concentrate on information

“Exactly. The aim of this channel is to
promote the games being shown on our national and cable carriers. This will not
be a channel you sit to watch constantly, but sort of a starting point which
will give you the information before you start to see the game. At night we
will be showing NBA highlights, both from that day’s games, and from our
massive archive. Be it select play-off series, or Magic Johnson’s great
moments. From noon ‘till the live broadcast starts, we will be showing the
magazines we produce, some of which you see here in Israel, such as “NBA Action”.
It’s possible that in the future we’ll be showing some international basketball
too.”

 

***Where do you see this channel going?***

“Once we have the sufficient bandwidth, we
will be able to achieve totally interactive television. Today on our web-site,
the viewer can freeze a frame and send it as a postcard. In the future – You will
be able to see a game, and with a click on your remote order the blouse that
Patrick Ewing is wearing. The same if you like Pat Riley’s Armani suits.

In the more distant future, the viewer will
have the option to be the director. We will be presenting him the feed from all
the cameras, including audio feed from the team’s benches, and we he will be
able to choose what to see – what the director chose, or one of the other
cameras. That’s the future, and our new channel is a first step in that
direction.”

 

***Who will be able to enjoy the new channel?*****

“Initially, not a lot of house-holds. Since
we’re talking about a digital channel, we’re limited with respect to bandwidth
in cable. So we our initial audience are satellite viewers, which are
subscribed to the NBA package, something like 3 million households. With time,
we will be broadening this also outside the states.”

 

***Lets talks a bit about basketball. Has the
NBA recovered from the damage caused by the players strike?***

“You know, You have to put in a good word for
the players, who together with us made an effort to reach out to the fans and
contact them. We had open training sessions, autograph signing event, players-fans
meetings before games and similar events. Even tough it was a short season, the
fans are back, ratings our back. Maybe we should have improved the connection
with the fans sooner, but no doubt that helped us get the fans back. At the end
of the season, no one suggested we put an asterisk on San-Antonio’s
championship. Except for the Knicks fans, of course”.

 

***One of the most surprising success stories of
recent years is the WNBA. Were you surprised as well?***

“This is really a big surprise beyond our wildest
dreams. Three years ago, when we started the league, we anticipated an average
of 5000 people per game. Today – the average is 10000. Who would have believed
it? Not to mention that television rights, it filled a big gap in our
broadcasting schedule. The summer was a ‘dead’ season for us, as far as
basketball is concerned. No with the WNBA, we can give basketball fans quality
games all year”
