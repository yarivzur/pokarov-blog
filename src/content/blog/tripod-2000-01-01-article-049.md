The Un-Official uTOK Team Page
Part V - Demo 2000**


Yes, Yes. We presented at [Demo 2000](http://www.demo2000.com), and yes, we kicked ass.
In this
picture you can see our marketing team (from right to left) - Vibeke, Mar(k)tin and Jules from our new company firm - BSMG.



And finally - Ed, our business guy. The only person who can
mingle with three contacts per minute



Here are Ed and yours truly. Notice Our booth. Isn't it kewl?



These guys again? Give us a break!



Finally, came the big Orit presentation, and was she glamarous that night! Oh, Yes, Oren was there too.



Same idea, different angle
