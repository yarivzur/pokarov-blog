Part IV - Guy's Dinner Party**


Our beloved Guy has left us for greener pastures (namely, [Tel-Aviv University](http://www.math.tau.ac.il)). We gathered in a Kosher (ugh!) place to celebrate.



Introducing - Aya, our company secretary, and the only person who still believes that Atlantis exists



 La Double Roni! On the left - Roni Biran, our geophysical WebMaster, On the right - It's Mr. Halperin, a.k.a. Brad Pitt



 Oren is obviously upset that Guy is leaving. Or is it the Kosher food? On the bottom left, you see enough of mickey to understand everything.



 Remember that bored, cynical look we talked [about](https://vlvl.tripod.com/uTOK/uTOK2.html)? Here it is again. Arale being bored, Guy playing with digital cameras.



 We are proud to introduce our bug-crasher, our QA queen, the only sane person in the company - [Dikla!](mailto:dikla@utok.com) Oh yes, and that pesky fellow - Roni.



 Here's a riddle for ya - A WebMaster, A General Manager, A CEO, and a programmer. Which one isn't smiling?



 Two Pictures, Both featuring a guy in a green shirt. Who is this, you wonder? Well, It's [Udi](http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~hoffman/udi/). Udi doesn't work for uTOK, he works for [Contact.com](http://www.contact.com), which is also a start-up company, only that they are successfull. Anyway, Udi helped us solve a really nasty bug code-named "The Black Demon". We Love you Udi!
