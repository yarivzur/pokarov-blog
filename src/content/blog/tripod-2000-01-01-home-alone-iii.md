# Home Alone III
Good Morning. It's 11:00, 13th July. I'm at work, managing my way between design meeting and sitting in the bathroom. Last night I had another weird dream, In which I get to drive a tres kewl dune-buggy. Of course, the natural thing to do was to return with the buggy to my old 'hood in Ra'anana. Just to show all those people who mocked me during my childhood that I *am* kewl. Arriving there, I found out that the buggy isn't working, and that this weird cable connecting the steering wheel to the wheels isn't working. Just my luck. There goes my delayed (belated?) revenge.

allez le bleu (sp?)
Yariv.
