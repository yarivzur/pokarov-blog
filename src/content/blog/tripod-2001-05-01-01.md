**Tue, 01 May 2001**

 

I am now in one of the happiest times of my life. I'm starting to come to terms with who I am, what I do and why. I've found someone who could be a true companion for this long journey. I love all my friends. I even like some of my family.

 

I spent a long time smoking in this small room in the office overlooking riding and the sea. Everything looks beautiful from the 17th floor, especially on a rainy day. Yair said the other day that rainy days in Tel-Aviv force you into a philosophical mood. I told him that it's rain in general, not in Tel-Aviv. Rain in New-York. Rain in London. Maybe not in San-Francisco, but that's because the rain there, like most everything else, is made of plastic.

 

When will Ugi be happy?

 

It doesn't matter where you are. You can have your fantasies in New-York. You can have your fantasies walking from the Mamalachti Bet elementary school in Ra'anana towards 'Gan David'. You can have your fantasies treading up and down mountains during 'nivutey tsafon'.

 

You can have fantasies anywhere. You can have reality anywhere.

 

I think it was Guy who once taught me that one of the major principles of Zen is that you are not what you did, you are not your actions now, you are not who you might be.

 

You are.
