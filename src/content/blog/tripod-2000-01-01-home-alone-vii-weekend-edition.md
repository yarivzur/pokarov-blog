# Home Alone VII - Weekend Edition
Shabat Shalom, Texties & Voicies.
Not to disturb the merry ICQ Chat you all share, I have found out the most important aspect of living alone. (Important is not exactly what I mean, but bear with me). It's the Determinism. The fact that nothing, and I mean nothing changes in the apartment is the most mind-boggling thing you can imagine. You leave the apt. at morning, come back 12 hrs. later - and lo and behold. Nothing has changed. Everything is in the same place (Well, except for when your landlord takes the libery to let in people from the Iriya). The light you forgot in the morning is still there. Ugi's radio still chanting. The same dishes in the sink. No-one took anything from the fridge. No one has consumed toilet-paper. Wow. Maybe that's why people keep a dog. They just need an element of randomness in their houses.

G'Day.

Yariv. All alone in da big city
