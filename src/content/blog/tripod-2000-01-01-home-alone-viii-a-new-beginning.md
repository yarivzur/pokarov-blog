# Home Alone VIII - A New Beginning
Good evening everyone.
First, some updates. Tamar & Myself are back together. This is mainly because I whimped out, and could not resist the temptation of make-up sex. As for living alone - Well, I still find myself increasingly looking at BP for randomness elements. I set myself a mission a day. One day it's the dishes (Thanks Ugi), One day it's the Tiyukim. I think tonight it will be the porch. All in all, I see a lot of Video films, and Home Cinema (Amazingly, not the Adult movies), and find solace in Binyamini's sporadic calls. Believe it or not - I actually look forward to the Miluim, since I have an idea for a short story based on it. While I couldn't view myself living alone a week ago, after a people-free weekend, I certainly can. It won't be easy, But if I have to choose between meeting new room-mates and getting a flat on my own, I tend to opt for the second.

Yariv. Somehow more rejuvinated and enthusiastic. Oh, and with regular bowel movements.

P.S. Saw E.T. last night. Still makes me cry.
