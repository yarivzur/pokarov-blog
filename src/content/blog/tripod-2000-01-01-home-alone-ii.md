# Home Alone II
I woke up this morning, with a splitting head-ache and queasy(sp?) legs. I went to the group dynamics, only to open up a big fight with the Rakezet, which I used to crave. After that I felt so bad, I decided I'd go home instead of work. All I really wanted ever since I woke up was a good old sensory-deprivation tank. Some peace, Some quiet. To sleep. Came home half-dead only to find I don't have keys. Called Ugi the saviour of lost souls, and spent the time untill he got there sleeping on the stairs like a bona fide hobo. Ugi came, bearing keys, and i was able to crash on my bed. In my dreams I've invented a whole new approach to physics. Too bad I don't remember it.
Things are now getting better. I only have a huge headache, but my legs are almost functional. 3.5 hours untill Brazil crushes France. I hope you find a way to see the game.
