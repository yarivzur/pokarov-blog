I think this picture says all that needs to be said about [Arale](mailto:arale@xpert.com), Our Server-King. Notice the sneering smile, the sardonic eyes, and you will fully understand what Arale thinks about his co-workers.


In this picture you may see the lovely back of Noa, our oh-so-very-talented Graphic Designer, as she is conversing with Mickey. To the uninitiated, this may seem like they're discussing important work matters, but it's so much more likely Mickey is just explaining to her how to get to the party
