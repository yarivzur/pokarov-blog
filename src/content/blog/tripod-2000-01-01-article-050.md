The Un-Official uTOK Team Page
Part VI - The SF Office**


OK, An updated page for the San Fran office. We start with Amy [Paris](http://www.paris.com/) (like the city), for the Business Development team.



How could we live without a picture of the office? Doesn't it look really good? Like a yuppy wet dream?



Now, Ed, can get sooo drunk sometimes...


You gotta wonder whay shannon is smiling...


Here we can see Kristy, the new Office Manager. As you can see, Kristy only drinks foreign beer. People have no respect to america anymore.


How could we forget Ramin? Ramin is the investor from T-Ventures.


Orit in another non-chalant picture, which just as to the reputation she already has...


Last but not least - Vibeke in extreme closeup
