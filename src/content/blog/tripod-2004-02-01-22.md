**Sun, 22 February 2004**

One of the things I really like about the american culture, is their need to preserve the appearance of 'fair-play'. You'd think it only extends to people & sports. Wrong. It can be found in the documentation of minute fucntions in the Win32 API:

"There is no guarantee about the order in which threads will obtain ownership of the critical section, however, the system will be fair to all threads."

(From the [InitializeCriticalSectionAndSpinCount()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/initializecriticalsectionandspincount.asp) documentation)
