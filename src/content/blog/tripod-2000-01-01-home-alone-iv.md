# Home Alone IV
Good morning, friends abroad and friends soon to be abroad.
It is another scorching morning in downtown Tel-Aviv, as I made my way between the grease puddles and the air-conditioners dripping on my gel-annointed hair, I tried to make a short re-cap of my life. I was going to write to you all about it, and marr your perfect morning with my whinings, untill I happened to stumble upon Cap'n Internet's Editorial. Allow me to qoute:
"Douglas Coupland insists on writing a book on Laura Croft (Tomb-Raider, VL) ... The Captain Wonders if Coupland, Which gained most of his fame after GenerationX, has any understanding of the current generation of computers games players. The GenX people spent most of the time sitting like couch-potatos in front of the TV. Interaction with people outside their salon ... was not an option. The people to which Coupland is trying to address today - are completely different ..." Aaaaaaargh!

Yariv.
