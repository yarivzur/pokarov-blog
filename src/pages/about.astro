    <h1>About Bitterness Inc.</h1>

    <p>
      This is my personal blog—a space for unfiltered thinking, cultural commentary,
      and writing that doesn't need to fit professional contexts.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm Yariv Zur. I run <a href="https://www.lokahi.me">Lokahi</a>, a strategic
      advisory firm. This is where I write about everything else.
    </p>

    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Cultural observations and commentary</li>
      <li>Essays on topics that catch my attention</li>
      <li>Book reviews and recommendations</li>
      <li>Whatever's on my mind</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>For Professional Work</h2>
